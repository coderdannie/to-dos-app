### What I learned

This is my first time of building a to-dos web application using react. What i learnt majorly is how to use arrays together with array methods and object.

### Continued development

I will focus more on how to use build complex project using arrays and also how to write more efficient code.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This helped me to know more about input radio button and some other css styles i used in this project.
- [Example resource 2](https://stackoverflow.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally to get solutions to all of the problem i encountered. I'd recommend it to anyone who get stuck or faces some issues while building this project.
